## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
### Description
This question is about merging two words by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 

If one of the words is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the final merged word.

### Solution1: Brute Force
Create a list to store the answer.

Create a variable to store the smaller length, which will be used to determine when to stop the loop.

Convert the lists to strings then concatenate the rest of the longer word onto the end of the new word.

```
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        word1, word2 = list(word1), list(word2)
        word3 = []
        small = min(len(word1), len(word2))
        i = 0
        while i < small:
            word3.append(word1[i])
            word3.append(word2[i])
            i += 1
        word3 = "".join(word3)
        
        if i < len(word1):
            word1 = "".join(word1)
            word3 += word1[i:]
        if i < len(word2):
            word2 = "".join(word2)
            word3 += word2[i:]
        
        return word3
```

### Solution2: Slightly Better Solution
Create an empty string to store the answer.

Iterate through both strings using an index i until reaching the end of the shorter string.

Concatenate remaining letters from the longer word.

```
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i = 0
        
        res = ""

        while i < len(word1) and i < len(word2):
            res += word1[i]
            res += word2[i]
            i += 1
        
        res += word1[i:]
        res += word2[i:]
        
        return res
```
